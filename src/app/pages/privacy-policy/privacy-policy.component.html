            <p class="j-phrase-desc">
                Fitness First uses tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons to make use of
                the website and services as convenient as possible. &nbsp;Cookies are pieces of
                information that a web site transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping
                purposes. &nbsp;Web Beacon is a technical method that sends information related to the
                access to websites, when you browse websites, open or preview an HTML-formatted email.
                &nbsp;Most web browsers are set to accept tracking technologies such as cookies or web
                beacons. &nbsp;These tracking technologies do not themselves personally identify users,
                although they do identify a user's browser. &nbsp;These tracking technologies allow
                Fitness First to monitor the Fitness First web site, and to record how many people are
                using the different parts of the site. It is possible to set the browser to refuse
                tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons, however, this may limit the
                services provided by Fitness First's web site.
